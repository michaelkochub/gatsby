## What is this?

This is the branch gh pages uses to serve content that you see when you hit `react.kochub.com`.

## What am I looking at?

All the files (excluding the CNAME record, the README you're currently reading, and the git internals) are the output from

```bash
npm run build
```

For more info head to the project README on the `master` branch and check out the build script responsible for this pushing
to this branch [here](https://github.com/michaelkochub/gatsby/blob/master/build-to-gh-pages.sh)
